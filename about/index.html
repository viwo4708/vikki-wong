      <p>Vikki Wong is a portrait and fashion photographer based out of Boulder, Colorado. She started shooting when she was
      19 years old, and has since worked with local businesses such as Common Threads, Disco Apocalypse, and Snow Jewelry Co. She has also
      shot Denver Fashion Week for 303 Magazine. Her favorite concept to photograph is androgynous fashion, but she is open to collaborate
      with any people who want to push creative boundaries and create striking, memorable imagery. She is dedicated to bringing out the best
      from her subjects, and pays meticulous attention to detail when shooting and editing.</p>
      <p>Currently, Vikki is also a student at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is majoring in Marketing and Computer Science, with a
      minor in Creative Technology and Design. She has experience with Adobe Suite, C++, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
